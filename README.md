Additional Information
----------------------
1. A log file `usage.log` is generated by the tool for debugging. Useful for debugging.
2. Incase of any issues/bugs, `usage.log` shall be referred to.
3. The proxies i.e. ip and port are read `http://spys.one/free-proxy-list/` website, and the script reads secure (https) available proxies from Tier-1 countries.
4. To control the countries to be used, proxies_scrape.py file can be manipulated. the property `tier_1_countries` contains the list of Tier-1 countries that are used to read proxies. The property `tier_1_countries_all` consists of all the available Tier-1 countries.
5. The Google re-captcha waiting time, i.e. time taken to wait for the recaptcha service is set to 30 seconds. However the service provider `https://anti-captcha.com/` claims around 10-12 seconds for the same. Just to be on the safer side, 30 seconds has been set as the limit.
